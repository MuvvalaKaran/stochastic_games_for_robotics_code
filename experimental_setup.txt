Experimental Setup:

Robot Actions: Robot can move ([robotmotion]), grasp ([robotgrasp]), transfer ([robotmotion]), and release ([robotplace]) an object or take no action ([robotnoop])
Human Actions: Human can perform the same actions as robot does and the naming convention is similar. 

rloc and hloc are physical locations that the robot and human can be at. We preserve 0 and 1 for robot gripper location and human gripper location. We preserve the last location for the terminal state. The rest of the locations are where the objects can be placed. 

Init state: All objects are grounded and stacked at location 2.
Final state: Both robot and human should be in their terminal state and objects should be in their desired locations.
